# Future Improvements 
Below is a list of items to be considered for future code improvements

* Code should be refactored to handle bulk requests of items (eg adding, deleting, searching) 
* Additional validation checks to ensure whether a test case passes or fails
* Add test case to clear all items 
* Testing has only been performed for Chrome, and cross-browser testing should be supported in future
* Additional test cases should be written to validate more E2E user scenarios  

### Note to Developers
A note that the test cases are angular specific - and rely heavily on the current framework. If this framework were to change, code would have to be updated.
